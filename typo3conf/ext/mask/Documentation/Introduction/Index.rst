What does it do?
----------------

Mask is a TYPO3-extension for creating contentelements and extend pagetemplates. It is possible to add new fields to any element. Fields can have serveral types, for example: text, file, relations, richtext,...

Advantage of Mask
-----------------

+ Mask stores the content in columns in databasetables - not in XML (Flexform)

+ Mask reuses existing database-fields to conserve the database

+ Mask works only with existing features of the TYPO3-core: backend_layouts, fluid, typoscript, 

+ Mask allows repeating content with IRRE-technology

+ Mask supports multilanguage projects and resolves some language-bugs of TYPO3

+ Mask supports workspaces and versioning

+ Mask is written in Extbase, the modern way to create extensions
